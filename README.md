## 📖 About The Project

**TransferIQ Pro** is an AI-powered football analytics platform designed to predict player transfer values using data-driven techniques.

In real-world football markets, player valuations are often influenced by hype, media narratives, and agent negotiations. This system eliminates subjectivity by combining:

- 📊 Performance Metrics  
- 🩹 Injury Risk Analysis  
- 🌍 Public Sentiment (NLP)

The system not only predicts a player’s **current market value** but also forecasts their **future valuation trend for the next 3 years** using deep learning.
